Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Overview

This project performs **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python.
The main aim is to understand the dataset, handle missing values and outliers, and prepare a clean dataset for further analysis or visualization.

Dataset

* Original file: `home_data.csv`
* Cleaned file: `cleaned_dataset.csv`

Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset and checked shape, info, and sample rows
2. Generated descriptive statistics
3. Calculated missing value percentages
4. Plotted histograms and boxplots
5. Detected outliers using the IQR method
6. Created an outlier flag column
7. Handled outliers using capping
8. Created a correlation matrix
9. Exported the cleaned dataset and findings

Project Files

* `task10_eda.ipynb` – EDA notebook
* `cleaned_dataset.csv` – cleaned dataset
* `eda_findings.txt` – summary of insights


 Outcome

A **clean dataset** ready for:

* Power BI / Tableau dashboards
* SQL analysis
* Further data analysis or modeling
